        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Since my early days as a clinical physiotherapist, I found myself constantly questioning what I saw.
            My colleagues probably thought I was lost in thought—and they were right! I was deep in a mindset of curiosity and research.
            I used to wonder: if I tell Gennaro (a hypothetical patient) to extend his leg or to touch his heel to the ground, the movement might look similar to the eye—and even in terms of kinematics.
            But what happens in the brain?
            Is there a difference in neural activation when a goal is present versus when it’s absent, even if the movement itself is identical?
        </p>
        <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
        <p>
            Goal-directed movements activate different neural patterns than identical movements without a goal.
